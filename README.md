## It gives an error :(. Now im sad

The package.json has been updated to automatically do this when you run it.
~~First try running~~
```sh
npm i
```

Ok, but how do i run it?
```
npm start
```
or you can use
```
node index.js
```
If you use the node path to launch, rembember to use `npm i` to install dependencies.

## Shucks :(. it still won't work!
